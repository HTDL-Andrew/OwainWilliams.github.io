# Andrew Hopkins

## About me
Hello world! My name is Andrew and I am a senior developer at [HTDL](https://www.htdl.co.uk) and have been using Umbraco for a few years now since V7.  Iâ€™m a full time, full stack web developer with about 24 years of experience from the tin-ter-net stone age, when dinosaurs ruled the earth. I started web development using Netscape Navigator & Internet Explorer 2, hand coding in notepad. I've returned to the ASP.net coding world after a gap of about 10 years working with other programming languages and now deep into learning dotnet core, Umbraco 9 and 10. I started out as a graphic designer so I'm one of those square pegs which can code, design and project manage from start to finish.

### Codegarden 2022
I will be attending the full online Codegarden 2022 this year and will try to make the journey one day, but unfortunately this year some family matters take priority. Thank you to Owain for injecting even more fun into proceedings with The Secret Stage and really embodying the spirit of Umbraco. Many of the people I've come into contact with whilst working in the Umbraco community are amazingly talented, creative, friendly folk who are always willing to share and help others. I'm really looking forward to seeing what the future will bring with Umbraco development, as it's awesome!!!
